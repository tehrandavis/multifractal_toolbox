# multifractal toolbox

This is a collection of Julia scripts for multifractal analysis of time series. At the moment toolbox has implementations of the following methods:

* Multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis (MFDFA)
* Chhabra-Jensen method

I am planning to add more methods in the future:
* Multifractal detrended cross-correlation analysis (MFDCCA)
* WTMM

## Installation

To install the toolbox, run the following command in Julia's REPL:

```
julia> include("multi_fractals.jl")
```

## Examples

A jupyter notebook with examples of using the toolbox is available in the `examples` folder.
